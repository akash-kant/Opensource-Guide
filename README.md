## üöÄ Advanced Contribution Strategies

### Understanding Project Structure

#### Common Files and Folders
```bash
# Project root files
.gitignore              # Files Git should ignore
.github/                # GitHub-specific configurations
package.json            # Node.js dependencies and scripts
requirements.txt        # Python dependencies
Gemfile                 # Ruby dependencies
Cargo.toml             # Rust dependencies
go.mod                 # Go modules
Dockerfile             # Container configuration
docker-compose.yml     # Multi-container setup

# Common folders
src/                   # Source code
docs/                  # Documentation
tests/                 # Test files
examples/              # Usage examples
scripts/               # Build and utility scripts
```

### Keeping Your Fork Updated
```bash
# Fetch changes from original repository
git fetch upstream

# Switch to your main branch
git checkout main

# Merge upstream changes
git merge upstream/main

# Push updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Advanced Git Workflows

#### Interactive Rebase (Clean Up Commits)
```bash
# Clean up your last 3 commits
git rebase -i HEAD~3

# In the editor that opens:
# pick = keep the commit as is
# squash = combine with previous commit
# reword = change commit message
# drop = remove the commit
```

#### Handling Merge Conflicts
```bash
# When conflicts occur during merge/rebase
git status  # Shows conflicted files

# Edit conflicted files manually
# Look for conflict markers:
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
# =======
# Their changes
# >>>>>>> branch-name

# After resolving conflicts:
git add resolved-file.txt
git commit  # Complete the merge
```
